# Neural Networks Implementation and Analysis
A basic neural network implementation and performance analysis that includes content relating to the sum of squared errors and hidden unit encodings.

# Use python 3.6.0. On the hpc:
- > module add python/3.6.0

# To run the neural network and produce the csv files:
- > python3 Task2.py

# We already include plots from the produced csv files, so you do not need to do worry about running plotting.py, which requires the third party pandas library.

# Deliverables
- D1 : the codebase itself
- D2/* : directory containing csv files with hidden unit encodings and sum of squared errors per epoch. The hidden unit encoding files are named according to which hidden unit the file refers to.
- D3/* : directory containing csv files with plots of hidden unit encodings and sum of squared errors per epoch. The hidden unit encoding files are named according to which hidden unit the file refers to.
- D4.HiddenRepresentations.csv : hidden Representations file
- D4.pdf : Analysis for task 4
- D5.pdf : Project Reflection
