# Neural Networks Implementation and Analysis
A basic neural network implementation and performance analysis that includes content relating to the sum of squared errors and hidden unit encodings.

# Use python 3.6.0. On the hpc:
- > module add python/3.6.0

# To run the neural network and produce the csv files:
- > python3 Task2.py

# We already include plots from the produced csv files, so you do not need to do worry about running plotting.py, which requires the third party pandas library.

# Deliverables
- Task2.py - (WRITE DESCRIPTION)
- neuralNetwork.py - (WRITE DESCRIPTION)
- D2 : folder containing files required for D2
- D3 : folder containing plots required for D3
- (MORE NEEDED)
