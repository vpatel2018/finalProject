# Neural Networks Implementation and Analysis
# A basic neural network implementation and performance analysis.

# Instructions
- > module add python/3.6.0
- > python3 main.py

# Notes
- We used pandas to produce our plots.
- You may get some warnings about not having pandas installed.
- There is no need to produce the plots, so just ignore them.

# Deliverables
- D1 : the codebase itself
- D2 : directory containing csv files with hidden unit encodings and sum of squared errors per epoch
- D3 : directory containing csv files with plots of hidden unit encodings and sum of squared errors per epoch
- D4.HiddenRepresentations.csv : hidden Representations file
- D4.pdf : Analysis for task 4
- D5.pdf : Project Reflection
